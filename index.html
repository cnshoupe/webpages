	<!--A papragraph about my major -->
	<p>Hi! My name is Caleb Shoupe and I am <ins>junior</ins> majoring in <strong>Civil Engineering</strong>. I chose this major for <em>several</em> reasons: the high demand for engineers and large workload in this field, the fact that I have always enjoyed observing this type of work being done, and the fact that I can make a good financial living in this field. 
	After believing this was a field that I would enjoy working while while making a good living I interned for several summers with NCDOT and decided that was indeed the path for me to follow. 
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<p style="font-family: Times; color: #000000; font-size: 16px; tex-align: left;">
		I am not <em>currently</em> working a job but I have interned the past <ins>two</ins> summers with the NCDOT in Asheville NC.
		I really enjoyed these summers as I was able to gain <strong>lots</strong> of valuable experience while making money school and multiple professional contacts and references.
		I will probably seek out an internship with another company this summer so that I can get experience in other areas of Civil Engineering seeing as it is a very broad field with many possibilities.
