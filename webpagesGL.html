	<p>Hi! My name is Caleb Shoupe and I am a transfer student in Civil Engineering.
	I am from a little town called Spruce Pine (2500 people!) in Western North Carolina, which to give some context that people will understand is about halfway between Asheville and Boone.
	Upon graduation from NC State, I hope to get a job back in the mountains where I am from and make my career there.
	I enjoy playing music, football, and being outdoors.
