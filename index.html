	<!--A papragraph about myself -->
	<p>Hi! My name is Caleb Shoupe and I am <ins>junior</ins> majoring in <strong>Civil Engineering</strong>. I chose this major for <em>several reasons</em>: the high demand for engineers and large workload in this field, the fact that I have always enjoyed observing this type of work being done, and the fact that I can make a good financial living in this field. 
	After believing this was a field that I would enjoy working while while making a good living I interned for several summers with NCDOT and decided that was indeed the path for me to follow. 
	 <ins></ins> <strong></strong>.
